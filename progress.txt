**Project Start:** January 15, 2026 16:30 UTC
**Current Phase:** ML Bot Production Stabilization
**Status:** Critical Bug Fix - Conflicting Positions

---

## Current Iteration - Emergency Stabilization (Jan 15, 2026)

**Goal:** Fix conflicting positions bug blocking ML bot profitability

**Context:**
- ML Random Forest model deployed to production
- Model shows 60% win rate (matches 67.3% test accuracy)
- Critical bug: Bot placing both Up AND Down on same crypto/epoch
- Result: Negating ML edge, causing losses despite correct predictions

**Bugs Fixed Today:**
1. ✅ ML not placing orders - Added order execution logic
2. ✅ Auto-redemption broken - Fixed epoch gating
3. ✅ Agent fallback causing conflicts - Removed guardian.add_position()
4. ❌ **BLOCKING:** Still getting conflicting positions (investigating)

**Current Stats:**
- Balance: $176.78
- Pending: 8 positions (4 cryptos × 2 directions each = CONFLICT)
- Win Rate: 60% on resolved trades
- Loss from bugs: ~$65 today

**Next Actions:**
1. Investigate why conflicts still occurring
2. Add explicit position conflict check
3. Disable agent system completely when ML enabled
4. Deploy and validate fix
