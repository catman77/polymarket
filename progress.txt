========================================
ITERATION 1 - Jan 15, 2026
========================================

STARTING POINT:
- Balance: $254.61 (+$247 today = +3,491% recovery from $7.09)
- Win Rate: 56-60% (ML Random Forest bot)
- Shadow Trading: FIXED and operational (92 decisions, 27 strategies running)
- 7 Agents Deployed: Tech, Sentiment, Regime, Candlestick, TimePattern, OrderBook, FundingRate

STRATEGIC DECISION:
Focus on OPTIMIZATION over COMPLEXITY. Don't add 12 agents and complex ensembles - optimize what's already working.

USER-APPROVED ROADMAP:
1. Week 1: Per-agent performance tracking (identify underperformers)
2. Week 2: Selective trading (test 0.80/0.70 thresholds)
3. Week 3: Kelly Criterion position sizing
4. Week 4: Automated promotion + alert system

GOALS:
- Win Rate: 56% → 60-65%
- Monthly ROI: +10-20% → +20-30%
- Automated optimization: Continuous

NEXT STEPS:
- Archive old PRDs (rename to *_archive)
- Create focused optimization PRD (4-week roadmap)
- Begin Phase 1: Per-agent tracking implementation

STATUS: ✅ Planning complete, ready for implementation

## ITERATION 2 - Jan 15, 2026 (Later Same Day)

**Phase 1: Per-Agent Performance Tracking** - STARTED

**Work Completed:**
1. ✅ File Management (TASK 1):
   - Archived old PRDs (PRD_ML_Stabilization.md, PRD_Multi_Agent_Comprehensive.md)
   - Created new focused optimization PRD.md (4-week roadmap)
   - Created new progress.txt tracking file
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with optimization focus

2. ✅ Database Schema Extension (TASK 2.1):
   - Extended simulation/trade_journal.py schema
   - Added agent_performance table (tracks per-agent win rates)
   - Added agent_votes_outcomes table (links votes to outcomes)

3. ✅ Agent Performance Tracker (TASK 2.2):
   - Created analytics/agent_performance_tracker.py
   - Implements agent vote → outcome matching
   - Calculates win rates per agent
   - Identifies underperformers (<50% win rate, 20+ votes)

4. ✅ Agent Enable/Disable Flags (TASK 2.3):
   - Added AGENT_ENABLED dict to config/agent_config.py
   - Added get_enabled_agents() helper function
   - Documented usage for performance-based control

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate AGENT_ENABLED flags into bot initialization
- Wait for 100+ trades to analyze agent performance
- Disable underperforming agents based on data
- Document findings and win rate improvement

**Target:** +2-3% win rate improvement by removing low-performing agents

**PRD Structure:**
- `PRD-strategic.md` = 4-week optimization roadmap (strategic overview)
- `PRD.md` = Current week implementation (user stories: US-001, US-002, etc.)
- Ralph loop compatible: Small stories, verifiable criteria, dependency-ordered

**Current User Stories:**
- US-001: ✅ Database schema (agent_performance, agent_votes_outcomes)
- US-002: ✅ Agent performance tracker module
- US-003: ✅ Agent enable/disable configuration
- US-004: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Integrate flags into bot initialization
- US-005: ⏳ BLOCKED - Wait for 100+ trades, analyze performance
