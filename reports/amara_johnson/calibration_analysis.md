# Agent Calibration Analysis

**Researcher:** Dr. Amara Johnson (Behavioral Finance Expert)
**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Task:** US-RC-028

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **NO DATA AVAILABLE**

The shadow trading database contains no resolved trades with agent votes.
Calibration analysis requires actual outcomes to compare against predicted confidence.

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for shadow strategies to accumulate resolved trades
2. Re-run this analysis after 50+ trades (for statistical significance)
3. Expected timeline: 2-3 days of live trading
