**Persona:** Colonel Rita 'The Guardian' Stevens (Risk Management Architect)

**Date:** 2026-01-16

**Objective:** Validate that tiered position sizing protects against catastrophic loss during 10-loss streaks.

## Executive Summary

**Status:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL RISK DETECTED**

## Analysis

### Tiered Sizing Effectiveness

**$50 → 10 losses:**
- First bet: $5.00
- Last bet: $2.31
- Reduction: 53.8%
- Assessment: Adaptive sizing working

**$100 → 10 losses:**
- First bet: $7.00
- Last bet: $4.42
- Reduction: 36.9%
- Assessment: Adaptive sizing working

**$200 → 10 losses:**
- First bet: $10.00
- Last bet: $8.28
- Reduction: 17.2%
- Assessment: Adaptive sizing working

### 30% Drawdown Threshold Analysis

**Closest call:** $200 → 10 losses
- Drawdown: 45.0%
- Margin from halt: 15.0 percentage points

❌ Exceeds halt threshold by: 15.0%

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL: Position Sizing Insufficient

**Problem:** Tiered sizing does not protect against 10-loss streaks at low balance levels.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Increase minimum tier:** Change <$30 tier from 15% → 10% per trade
2. **Add loss streak protection:** After 5 consecutive losses, reduce all tiers by 50%
3. **Lower minimum bet:** Consider $0.75 minimum (if CLOB allows) for more gradual scaling
4. **Add circuit breaker:** Halt trading after 7 consecutive losses (before hitting 30% drawdown)

### Balance-Specific Guidance

**$50 → 10 losses:** HIGH RISK
- Max loss: $36.90 (73.8% drawdown)
- ❌ Would trigger halt at loss #4

**$100 → 10 losses:** HIGH RISK
- Max loss: $60.25 (60.2% drawdown)
- ❌ Would trigger halt at loss #4

**$200 → 10 losses:** HIGH RISK
- Max loss: $90.02 (45.0% drawdown)
- ❌ Would trigger halt at loss #6

## Conclusion

**Verdict:** FAIL ❌

Tiered sizing is INSUFFICIENT. Worst case drawdown (73.8%) exceeds 30% halt threshold. Immediate action required.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement recommended position sizing changes IMMEDIATELY
2. Add loss streak circuit breaker (halt after 7 consecutive losses)
3. Re-run stress tests after changes
4. Monitor first 50 live trades under new rules
