- **Moderate Severity:** 0
- **Low Severity:** 0

**Overall Verdict:**
🟢 **CLEAN:** No critical anomalies - data appears trustworthy


---

## Anomaly Categories

✅ **No anomalies detected** - all statistical tests passed

---

## Detailed Analysis

⚠️ **No trade data available for analysis**

---

## Statistical Tests Performed

1. **Rolling Win Rate Analysis**
   - Window size: 20 trades
   - Checks for sudden jumps (>30%)
   - Checks for suspiciously stable variance

2. **Outcome Distribution Test**
   - Runs test for independence
   - Expected: Random Bernoulli process
   - Detects: Clustering or alternating patterns

3. **Entry Price Validation**
   - Range check: $0.01 - $0.99 (valid for binary options)
   - Uniformity check: Detects identical prices
   - Precision analysis: Decimal place consistency

4. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**
   - Performance by hour of day
   - Detects: Time-based biases
   - Expected: Consistent across hours

5. **Crypto-Specific Analysis**
   - Win rate by asset (BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP)
   - Expected: Similar across cryptos (strategy agnostic)
   - Detects: Large disparities (>40%)

6. **Shadow Strategy Sanity Checks**
   - Random baseline should not beat default
   - Inverse strategies should not win consistently
   - Detects: Impossible results

7. **Outlier Detection**
   - P&L events >3 standard deviations from mean
   - Identifies: Extreme wins/losses
   - Requires: Manual review for legitimacy

## Recommendations

🟢 **DATA CLEAN:**
1. Continue with strategy optimization
2. Maintain regular anomaly monitoring
3. Set up automated alerts for future anomalies

📈 **DATA VOLUME:**
- Only 0 trades analyzed (need ≥100 for statistical significance)
- Continue collecting data before drawing conclusions
