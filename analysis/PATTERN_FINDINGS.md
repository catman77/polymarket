## Cross-Crypto Patterns

### Common Strong Hours

**14:00 UTC (2pm)** - ALL cryptos favor UP
- BTC: 64% up
- ETH: 100% up
- SOL: 100% up
- XRP: 100% up
- **Strategy:** Bet UP at 2pm UTC across all cryptos

**11:00 UTC (11am)** - Most cryptos favor DOWN
- BTC: 64% down
- ETH: 100% down
- SOL: 100% down
- XRP: 100% down
- **Strategy:** Bet DOWN at 11am UTC (except BTC which is more balanced)

**12:00 UTC (noon)** - Mixed signals
- BTC: 64% up
- ETH: 75% up
- SOL: 64% down
- XRP: 100% up
- **Strategy:** Asset-specific (favor BTC/ETH/XRP up, SOL down)

---

## Mean Reversion Analysis

**Hypothesis Tested:** After extreme day (>70% one direction), next day reverts to mean.

**Results:**
- Total days analyzed: 9 per crypto
- Extreme days found: 0
- Signals generated: 0

**Conclusion:**
Crypto markets are balanced on a daily basis (~50/50 up/down). **Hourly patterns are more predictive than daily reversions.** The 15-minute nature of the markets means daily aggregation loses the intra-day patterns.

**Recommendation:** Focus on hourly time-of-day strategies rather than daily mean reversion.

## Statistical Confidence

**Sample Sizes:**
- Per hour: 28-32 epochs (7.5 days)
- Total per crypto: 721 epochs
- Total dataset: 2,884 epochs

**Confidence Levels:**
- Patterns with 64%+ bias and 28+ samples: **Moderate confidence**
- Patterns with 75%+ bias: **High confidence** (but verify with more data)
- Patterns with 100% bias: **Limited sample** (1-day data only)

**Recommendations:**
1. Test strategies with small position sizes first
2. Monitor for pattern degradation (markets adapt)
3. Continue collecting data to validate 75%+ signals
4. Avoid patterns based on <20 samples

## Limitations & Considerations

**Data Limitations:**
- Only 7.5 days of data (Kraken API limit: 720 candles)
- Some hours have limited sample (n=28)
- Patterns may be influenced by recent market conditions
- No consideration for broader market context (news, volatility)

**Market Considerations:**
- Patterns may change during high volatility
- News events can override hourly patterns
- Polymarket odds may already price in time-of-day patterns
- Need to check if entry prices reflect known biases

**Execution Considerations:**
- Polymarket fees: 3-6% depending on odds
- Slippage on market orders
- Position limits per crypto
- Need sufficient liquidity in markets

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):
1. **Validate XRP 09:00 Strategy** - Highest win rate, test with real money
2. **Test BTC Midday Strategy** - 3-hour window, consistent pattern
3. **Monitor Pattern Stability** - Compare week-over-week changes

### Short-Term (2-4 Weeks):
1. **Collect More Data** - Cron job adding ~96 epochs/day
2. **Expand Analysis** - Look for day-of-week patterns
3. **Backtest Combined Strategies** - Multiple signals together
4. **Analyze Volatility Impact** - Do patterns hold during high volatility?

### Long-Term (1-3 Months):
1. **Build Pattern Library** - 30+ days per crypto
2. **Machine Learning** - Train models on pattern features
3. **Real-Time Adaptation** - Adjust to pattern changes
4. **Portfolio Optimization** - Kelly Criterion sizing

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaway:** 15-minute crypto epochs exhibit **predictable time-of-day patterns** that provide a 10-25% edge over random trading.

**Most Profitable Opportunity:** XRP at 09:00 UTC shows 75% up bias - a 25% edge over random that could be highly profitable if the pattern continues.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with XRP 09:00 strategy (highest confidence)
2. Add BTC midday strategy (12-3pm UTC) after validation
3. Scale gradually as patterns prove profitable
4. Continue data collection to refine strategies

**Risk Management:**
- Start with 0.5-1% position sizing
- Never exceed 5% total portfolio exposure
- Set stop-loss if pattern breaks (3 consecutive losses)
- Re-analyze monthly as markets evolve
