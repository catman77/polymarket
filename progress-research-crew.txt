# Progress Log - Research Crew

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-RC-001: Parse and validate trade log completeness
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:21
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/parse_trade_logs.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/trade_log_completeness.md (created)
- PRD-research-crew.md (marked US-RC-001 complete)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: Trade logs have inconsistent formatting for ORDER PLACED messages
  - Some use "Entry: $0.15", others "Entry: 0.15", others "Entry:$0.15"
  - Regex must be flexible to handle variations
- Pattern: WIN/LOSS messages appear separately from ORDER PLACED (different timestamps)
  - Fuzzy matching required: match by crypto + direction + timestamp within 20 min window
- Pattern: Epoch IDs sometimes appear in different formats:
  - "epoch_id: abc123-def456" (parentheses)
  - "epoch_id: ghi789" (standalone)
  - Sometimes missing entirely
- Gotcha: Must use 'encoding=utf-8, errors=ignore' when reading logs to handle potential encoding issues
- Gotcha: datetime.strptime requires exact format match - must handle parsing failures gracefully
- Context: Report thresholds: >95% = EXCELLENT, >85% = GOOD, >70% = ACCEPTABLE, <70% = POOR
- Context: Statistical significance requires ≥100 trades minimum (noted in recommendations)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created Trade dataclass with all required fields + is_complete() method
- TradeLogParser uses regex patterns for ORDER, WIN, LOSS extraction
- Fuzzy outcome matching: matches trades to outcomes within 20 min window (typical epoch + resolution time)
- Report includes: executive summary, detailed stats, per-crypto breakdown, quality assessment, recommendations
- Script accepts log_file as CLI argument, generates markdown report
- Tested on sample log data: correctly parsed 5 trades, identified 4 incomplete (80% missing outcomes)
- Typecheck passed with py_compile

## Iteration 2 - Task 7.2: Survivorship Bias Detection
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:30
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/survivorship_bias_analysis.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/survivorship_bias_report.md (generated)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: Division by zero must be guarded when len(list) might be 0
  - Always check if len(trades) > 0 before calculating percentages
- Pattern: Git history checks can timeout on large repos
  - Use timeout parameter in subprocess.run() (30 seconds)
  - Wrap in try/except to handle gracefully
- Pattern: Empty data scenario must generate valid reports
  - Tool should still produce useful output even with no data
  - Helps validate the tool works before receiving VPS data
- Gotcha: Config files may not exist in development environment
  - Check os.path.exists() before parsing config files
  - Provide fallback behavior when config missing
- Gotcha: SQLite database may not exist if shadow trading hasn't run
  - Handle missing database gracefully with error message
  - Tool should not crash if optional data sources missing
- Context: Survivorship bias detection focuses on:
  - Missing trading days (gaps in date range)
  - Removed shadow strategies (filtered after poor performance)
  - Version evolution tracking (v12 vs v12.1 comparison)
  - Git history auditing (deleted log files)
- Context: Report includes risk level assessment:
  - 🟢 LOW: No bias indicators
  - 🟡 MODERATE: 1 concern
  - 🔴 HIGH: 2+ concerns

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created comprehensive survivorship bias detector
- Parses bot.log for all trades with timestamps
- Matches outcomes (WIN/LOSS) to trades via fuzzy matching (20 min window)
- Analyzes time periods to detect missing days
- Tracks strategy version evolution (v12 vs v12.1)
- Audits shadow strategy database for removed strategies
- Checks git history for deleted data
- Generates detailed markdown report with risk assessment
- Handles edge cases: no data, missing files, division by zero
- Report structure:
  1. Time period analysis (date coverage, missing days)
  2. Strategy evolution (v12 vs v12.1 performance)
  3. Shadow strategy filtering audit (removed strategies)
  4. Backtest vs forward test classification
  5. Overall verdict with risk level
  6. Actionable recommendations
- Typecheck passed with py_compile
- Successfully generates report even with no input data

## Iteration 3 - Task 7.3: P-Hacking & Overfitting Detection
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:42
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/overfitting_detection.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/overfitting_detection_report.md (generated)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: SQLite database schema uses `predicted_direction` vs `actual_direction` comparison for win/loss
  - Not a simple "outcome" column - must compare two direction fields
  - WIN = when predicted_direction == actual_direction
  - LOSS = when predicted_direction != actual_direction
- Pattern: Database joins require careful foreign key relationships
  - strategies.name → outcomes.strategy (not strategy_id)
  - LEFT JOIN preserves strategies with no trades yet
- Pattern: Report generation must handle missing data gracefully
  - Use .get() with defaults instead of direct dictionary access
  - Check for None/empty lists before calculations
  - Provide meaningful output even with zero data
- Gotcha: KeyError when accessing dictionary keys without checking existence
  - Always use dict.get(key, default) for optional values
  - Define variables before using in f-strings
- Gotcha: Division by zero when len(strategies) might be 0
  - Use max(len(strategies), 1) in calculations as safety net
- Context: Bonferroni correction formula: α_corrected = α_original / number_of_tests
  - With 27 strategies, corrected α = 0.05 / 27 = 0.00185
  - Prevents false positives from multiple hypothesis testing
- Context: Overfitting risk levels:
  - 🟢 LOW: 0 concerns detected
  - 🟡 MODERATE: 1-2 concerns
  - 🔴 HIGH: 3+ concerns
- Context: Walk-forward validation is gold standard for time-series data
  - Train on Period 1, test on Period 2
  - Retrain on Period 1-2, test on Period 3
  - Prevents future data leakage

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created comprehensive overfitting detection tool
- Loads configuration parameters from config/agent_config.py
- Analyzes shadow strategy performance from SQLite database
- Calculates Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold
- Groups strategies by type (conservative, aggressive, ML, etc.)
- Detects overfitting signs:
  - Top performers vs baseline comparison
  - Inverse strategy performance (anti-predictive agents)
  - Win rate distribution variance
  - High vs low confidence filter comparison
- Generates detailed markdown report with:
  - Executive summary with risk level
  - Current parameter configuration
  - Multiple testing correction calculations
  - Parameter sensitivity analysis
  - Overfitting detection results
  - Top 10 strategies leaderboard
  - Actionable recommendations

  - Feature leakage audit checklist
  - Full strategy performance appendix
  - Statistical formulas reference
- Handles edge cases: no database, empty tables, missing config
- Typecheck passed with py_compile
- Successfully generates report even with no shadow trading data

## Iteration 4 - Task 7.4: Statistical Anomaly Detection
**Persona:** Dr. Kenji Nakamoto (Data Forensics Specialist)
**Completed:** 2026-01-16 09:51
**Files Changed:**
- scripts/research/statistical_anomaly_detection.py (created)
- reports/kenji_nakamoto/statistical_anomaly_report.md (generated)

**Learnings:**
- Pattern: Log parsing requires multiple regex patterns (ORDER PLACED vs WIN/LOSS)
  - ORDER format: timestamp + crypto + direction + entry price
  - OUTCOME format: timestamp + WIN/LOSS + crypto + direction + P&L
  - Must fuzzy match by time window (20 min) + crypto + direction
- Pattern: Rolling window analysis for time-series data
  - Window size of 20 trades balances sensitivity vs noise
  - Calculate metric for each window position
  - Detect sudden jumps (>30%) or suspicious stability (variance < 0.001)
- Pattern: Runs test for independence in binary outcomes
  - Count "runs" (sequences of same outcome: WWW or LLL)
  - Expected runs = (2 * wins * losses) / n + 1
  - Too few runs = clustering (not independent)
  - Too many runs = alternating pattern (also suspicious)
- Gotcha: Empty lists break statistics calculations
  - Always check len(list) before calculating mean/variance
  - Return empty results early if insufficient data
- Gotcha: Division by zero in runs test
  - Use conditional: expected_runs > 0 before comparisons
- Context: Statistical anomaly severity levels:
  - 🔴 HIGH: Critical issues (impossible prices, inverse strategies winning, 100%/0% win rates)
  - 🟡 MODERATE: Suspicious patterns (outliers >3σ, unusual clustering)
  - 🟢 LOW: Expected patterns (consistent decimal precision)
- Context: Binary option prices must be $0.01-$0.99
  - Outside this range = impossible (data corruption)
  - All identical prices = suspicious uniformity
- Context: Outlier detection using 3-sigma rule
  - Calculate mean and std dev of P&L
  - Outliers = |pnl - mean| > 3 * std_dev
  - Normal distribution: 99.7% within 3σ, so outliers are rare
- Context: Temporal bias detection (hour of day)
  - Perfect win rate (100%) in any hour = suspicious
  - Zero win rate (0%) in any hour = suspicious
  - Expected: Roughly consistent across hours

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created comprehensive statistical anomaly detection tool
- Parses bot.log for ORDER PLACED and WIN/LOSS entries
- Fuzzy matches outcomes to orders (20 min window)
- Implements 7 anomaly detection tests:
  1. Rolling win rate clustering (20-trade window)
  2. Outcome distribution (runs test for independence)
  3. Entry price validation (range $0.01-$0.99, uniformity check)
  4. Temporal patterns (win rate by hour, perfect/zero rates)
  5. Crypto-specific analysis (win rate disparity >40%)
  6. Shadow strategy sanity checks (baseline vs default, inverse strategies)
  7. Outlier detection (P&L >3 standard deviations)
- Generates detailed markdown report with:
  - Executive summary with verdict (CRITICAL/WARNING/CLEAN)
  - Anomaly categories grouped by type
  - Detailed analysis (win rate stats, crypto breakdown, entry price distribution)
  - Statistical tests performed (descriptions)
  - Actionable recommendations based on severity
  - Data volume warning if <100 trades
  - Full appendix of all detected anomalies
- Handles edge cases: missing log file, zero trades, empty database
- Provides meaningful output even with no data
- Typecheck passed with py_compile
- Successfully generates report with no input data
